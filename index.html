                              <p>The goal of this project is to create a game in which the user runs endlessly until the user falls off the blocks. <br>
                                The user must stay on the moving blocks in order to continue the game. <br>
                                The keys w, a, d, and space are used to control the motion of the player. <br>
                                Keys:<br>
                                  w: move character forward<br>
                                  a: move character to the left<br>
                                  d: move character to the right<br>
                                  space: character jumps</p></div>
