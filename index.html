                              <p>The goal of this project is to create a game in which the user runs endlessly until the user falls off the blocks. 
                                The user must stay on the moving blocks in order to continue the game. 
                                The keys w, a, d, and space are used to control the motion of the player. 
                                Keys:
                                  w: move character forward
                                  a: move character to the left
                                  d: move character to the right
                                  space: charatcer jumps</p></div>
